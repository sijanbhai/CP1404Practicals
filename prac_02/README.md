I usually watch them the day before class for 2 hours at night.

I'm staying consistent with practical exercises and making sure I apply what I learn in lectures. I also take short notes to help me understand key concepts.
## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to start working on assignments before the last minute work to avoid stress.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

I tend to rush through practicals without fully testing different cases. Moving forward, I’ll take more time.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

I’m doing well in breaking problems into functions and following good coding practices, like using meaningful variable names and keeping my code modular. I also review my code before submitting it, which helps catch errors.
